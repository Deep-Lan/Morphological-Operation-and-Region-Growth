# Morphological-Operation-and-Region-Growth
Morphological operation and region growth application.

"experiment report.pdf" is experiment report,and you can regrad it as instruction."cell2.BMP" are experimental object. "morphological operation and regional growth.py" is python script

"rect.bmp" "rect-45åº¦.bmp" "rect-move.bmp" and "fourier.py" are correlated to the first one of 4 experiments. "grid.bmp" and "high-pass and low-pass.py" are correlated to the second one of 4 experiments. "lena.bmp" and "sine-wave.py" are correlated to the third one of 4 experiments. "cave.jpg" and "homomorphism.py" are correlated to the last one of 4 experiments. All the python scripts are independent.You can run them one by one.

Note:All these pictures and python scripts need to be taken in the same sub-directory.If you want to run them, you should run them in python3.And modules "PIL" "numpy" "matplotlib"and"skimage" are necessary.Otherwise,you could get back errors.
